# Web-APIs-Challenge-Code-Quiz

This will be used to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores. This quiz has a timer that starts when you click the start button. This quiz will go through 10 multiple choice questions. The quiz will finish either when you answer all 10 questions or when the timer reaches 0 whichever comes first. This allowed me to learn more about javascript as well as web APIs.
